Welcome to the GitHub page of our Software Engineering project with the name UltimateRecipeHunter.                                                          
We are a group of three german guys with the beatiful names Felix, Timo and Miko and we try to develop a little game in jump & run style. Your character is a cute chef. The goal is to collect as many recipes as possible to create a big meal.
